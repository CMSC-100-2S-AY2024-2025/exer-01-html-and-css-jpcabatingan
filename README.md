What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
Creating websites requires developers to have a clear and well-planned layout of how they want their website
to look like and the content it includes. It is also important to keep the design simple for a seamless
user-experience. The design should also be based on the purpose of the website. For our exercise, the design is
static since it is a portfolio and only requires the necessary info such as my personal info, skills, and experience.
